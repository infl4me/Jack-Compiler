Projects 10 and 11 of the nand2tetris course: https://github.com/infl4me/nand2tetris

Project 10 objective: In this project we build a syntax analyzer that parses Jack programs according to the Jack grammar, producing an XML file that renders the program's structure using marked-up text. In the next project, the logic that generates the XML output will be morphed into logic that generates VM code.

Project 11 objective: In this project we complete the construction of the Jack Compiler that we started building in the previous project.
